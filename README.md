There are two branches:

- `next-axiom` shows a setup of next.js 15 with next-axiom
- `axiomhq-logging` shows a setup of Next.js 15 with the new modular `@axiomhq/*` packages

See git history for each one - the first commit is a freshly scaffolded `create-t3-app` with trpc, the second commit is all the changes required to log from a trpc procedure.
